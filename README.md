Code to print Calendar with optional parameters (w, l, c and m) for date column width, lines per week,  number of spaces between month columns, and m-column calendar for an entire year as a multi-line string.
Explanation: The "advantage" of from Calendar import * as opposed to other forms of import is that it imports everything (well, almost everything) from the designated module under the current module. This allows using the various objects (variables, classes, methods...) from the imported module without prefixing them with the module's name.
